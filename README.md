# Zerith H1 Pro

Forge robot and independent camera-only nodes for Zerith H1 Pro.

## Migration status

Target node version: **2.0.0**. These changes are candidates pending the platform,
hardware and sustained-stream acceptance gates below. A version declaration does not
mean a stable release has been accepted.

Forge Common/Msgs/Robot and Dora move to the 2.x/1.x lines. Failed camera registration disconnects the driver; runtime errors return failure. Both robot and camera binaries are built from the committed lock and expose --version.

## Runtime and platform

- First validation combination: Dora CLI/coordinator/daemon/node APIs 1.0.1,
  Forge Msgs 2.0.0 and Common 2.1.0; use only the families required by this node.
- Forge wire schemas remain `forge_msgs.v1`. Dora 0.x and 1.x cannot share a runtime.
- Use Python 3.12 for Python builds. Camera-only Python packages may also declare
  Python 3.11 support; test that interpreter separately before claiming it.
- Rust packages enable `arrow-v59`; the committed lock uses Arrow 59.3.0.
- Hardware camera/robot artifacts target Linux. macOS development tests do not
  qualify Linux binaries. GPU/rendering and vendor SDK prerequisites still apply.
- Keep a recoverable `stable/1.x` runtime and artifact combination.

## Setup and commands

Run from the repository root:

```sh
uv sync --frozen --extra test --python 3.12
uv run --frozen robots_zerith_h1_pro_camera --config config/config.example.yaml
```

Use `robots_zerith_h1_pro_camera --help` (or `uv run --frozen robots_zerith_h1_pro_camera --help`) for supported CLI options.
The example configuration is `config/config.example.yaml`; choose the actual device and supported
stream profiles before starting. This command requires an appropriate Dora dataflow.

## Message contract

Camera output IDs and RGB/depth streams follow the camera configuration. The main robot entry also supports joint and locomotion control; inspect --help before device operations.

Keep bounded queues for high-rate image consumers and document whether old images
are dropped or producers experience backpressure. Preserve image dimensions, dtype,
encoding, units and capture metadata across the node boundary.

## Tests and build

```sh
uv run --frozen pytest tests -q
bash scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh
```

Use the committed `uv.lock` and frozen/locked installs. Python vendor SDK tests require
the supported SDK platform. For Linux headless MuJoCo rendering, install the required
EGL or OSMesa libraries and select the appropriate `MUJOCO_GL` backend.

Validate every delivered example or rendered template with:

```sh
dora validate path/to/dataflow.yaml
```

Schema validation is followed by a real start, message exchange and stop test.
Keep the existing detailed configuration and device setup reference in
[the Chinese guide](README_zh.md) and the repository's `config/`, `examples/` and
`scripts/` directories where present.

## Acceptance and release

1. Build candidate archives from the selected commit/tag and record actual embedded
   dependency versions, platform, archive SHA256 and unpacked executable SHA256.
2. Install the final archive into a clean supported environment. Verify the CLI,
   message contract, resource cleanup and error exits.
3. For image producers, run real supported RGB/depth configurations for at least
   four continuous hours after warmup. Exercise slow/multiple consumers, stalled
   consumption, failures and repeated start/stop. Define throughput, latency and
   memory limits before testing, and retain time series rather than frame payloads.
4. Exercise the relevant device; synthetic streams do not qualify hardware capture.
   Demonstrate rollback to the complete old node/runtime combination.
5. Publish the exact accepted archive. Rebuilding invalidates that artifact's
   acceptance; repeat it before publication. Never overwrite published tags/assets.
